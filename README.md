# Stock-synthesis-toolbox-for-ICES-benchmarks
Code and scripts for ICES stock synthesis benchmark models

1.	Run script (1. Ensemble_grid_Northern Seabass_example.R) for creating the models grid diagnostic table (1. Ensemble_grid_Northern Seabass_example.R); it creates the diags table and some plots of the next script
2.	Run script (2. Diags_Compare_refruns_lobster3a example.Rmd) for presenting and comparing the different models of the grid 
3.	Run script (3. Lobster3a_basecase model example.Rmd) for presenting the best case 
4.	Script for the F Forecast but with also biomass options, same SSB as year before, Btrigger and Blim (Henning to be modified for ICES purposes)
5.	Script for MSE for reference point estimation (example with 2 models, a best case and a robustness test)
6.	Script for profiling M and h at the same time (new from Laurie, I have it)
7.	Script for profiling M at age with breakpoints (new from Iago, I have it)
8.	Script for jittering (I have it from NOAA, new wrapper)
