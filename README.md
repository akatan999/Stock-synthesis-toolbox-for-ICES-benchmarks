# Stock-synthesis-toolbox-for-ICES-benchmarks
Code and scripts for ICES stock synthesis benchmark models

1.	Run script (1. Ensemble_grid_Lobster3a_example.R) for creating the models grid diagnostic table; it creates the diags table and some plots for the next script
2.	Run script (2. Diags_Compare_refruns_Lobster3a example.Rmd) for presenting and comparing the different models of the grid 
3.	Run script (3. Lobster3a_basecase model example.Rmd) for presenting the best case 
4.	Script for the F Forecast but with also biomass options, same SSB as year before, Btrigger and Blim (Henning to be modified for ICES purposes)
5.	Run script for running MSE to estimate reference points as from WKREFNEW reccomandations (example with 2 models, a best case and a robustness test)
6.	Script for profiling M and h at the same time (new from Laurie, I have it)
7.	Script for profiling M at age with breakpoints (new from Iago, I have it)
8.	Script for jittering (I have it from NOAA, new wrapper)
9.	Use fishlife for estimating life history priors (Fishlife.R)
